# Hello-World
Just a trial
My name is AbdulHameed and i am a student of university of lagos Nigeria.
I'm learning backend development at the moment and i hope to be very good at it in at most the next 4 months.
My stack is PHP and i will learn Laravel very soon to use it as my framework.
When i'm good at this backend to a certain stage, i'd like to learn more things in tech (still not sure on what to learn) and i hope that Almighty Allah puts me through and make it easy for me.
